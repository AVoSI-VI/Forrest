# Forrest
New home of Forrest-python rewritten in nim language

## TODO List:
- reimplement all features already created in Forrest-python -> creating file tree and objects, setting a remote repo, commits, logs, file rollback, clone from local repo
- cloneing from a remote repo
- only saving diffs to save on storage space
- compressing file objects to save on space
- branching and merging
- TBD
